#School Attendance System

This is a 10-part code-along project to build a comprehensive school attendance system using Java.

## Session 1: Introduction and Orientation

- Verified Java and Git setup.

Initialized Git repository.

Created basic project structure with 'Main.java`.

- Successfully compiled and ran the initial application.

## Session 2: Core Domain Modelling
- Defined Student class with studentId, name, setDetails(), and displayDetails() method.
- Defined Course class with courseId, courseName, setDetails(), and displayDetails() method.
- Utilized arrays of objects in Main.java to manage and display multiple students and courses.
- Introduced basic usage of this keyword.

## Session 3: Constructor Initialization & Auto-ID Generation
- Implemented parameterized constructors in Student and Course classes for object initialization.
- Utilized private static member variables for automatic and unique ID generation.
- Demonstrated the use of the this keyword to distinguish instance variables from constructor parameters.
- Changed Course's courseId to int for simpler auto-generation and updated its display.
- Updated Main.java to use constructors and show ID progression.
